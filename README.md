# ODDM Simulator (MATLAB)
A MySQL-MATLAB simulator for calculating error rates in OFDM, OTFS, ODDM and TODDM.

## Instructions
To use this code, you must run it in MATLAB 2024b or higher. You may need to create some folders for it to work, but I think I made create commands for all of them.

For any questions please contact jrwimer@uark.edu.
